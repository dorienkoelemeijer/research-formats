My design and research process is probably quite standard: it starts of with research in the from of a literature review of the chosen field(s), as well as as an analysis of related work, and sometimes field research. Parallel to this, I sketch and make notes (see uploaded files). If the sketches in my sketchbook are thought to be relevant for the process later on, I scan them in, and sometimes hang them in the place i work (trying to keep an overview of everything this way). The sketches are also good to be used to explain the design process to other people (supervisors, stakeholders).
I often do not document my process very well, but have been trying to get better at it. For the past thesis project I have documented my work through photos of all practical aspects (mainly user testing and prototyping) that generate findings, which were used to make design decisions. Also, it kind of functions as a “proof” that you did certain things, complementing the things you state in the written part of the research. 
Moreover, as part of the written process I frequently save my file as a new version, usually multiple times a day, so I can always access the things I wrote in the beginning of the process (don’t know if this is relevant in any way).

I hope I understood your assignment correctly + I’ve uploaded some pictures of the way I documented my TP2. You can always ask me if you need more info.
